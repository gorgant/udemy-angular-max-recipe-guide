TODO: 
- create a directive that allows us to add a certain css class to the element it sits on once it is clicked, and removes that class when the element is clicked again
- create a method that listens to clicks and toggles a property that indicates whether a class is attached or not
- try implementing some code that dynamically attaches a css class or not
- implement this on recipe-detail (<div class="btn-group open">)
