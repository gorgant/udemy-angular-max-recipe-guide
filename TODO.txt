TODO: 
- Emit a click event on the single recipe item component
- Send that to the recipes component and pass it to the recipe detail section
- Requires property and event binding

current sitch: I've set up the emit, now need to figure out how to receive it in the Recipes component (need to set up the listener in the HTML) and then pass that to the recipe detail section (guesssing I'll need an input setup similar to the recipe list)
